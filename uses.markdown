What I use to get the job done, including hardware and software, I truly
believe in implicity. I like simple tools that allow customisation for power
users.

## Hardware

### MacBook Pro

I love Apple products.

I bought my third MacBook Pro(13-inch) at 2018. It has 16 GB memory and 512 GB of
storage.

But in the Office, I use a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015) to work.

## Software

### iTerm2

I use iTerm2 instead of Terminal. I do everything here.

### Tmux

Tmux helps me to improve my workflow and to be more productive.

### Vim

I'm a Vim guy, write all code in Vim, from the command line. Love it simple,
configurable.

Vim is free and has a vibrant community, works over telnet and SSH connections.
I wrote a series of articles to introduce and use it.

## Services

### Spotify & Apple Music

Can't live without music. It's very important to me, especially in my cluttered
Office.

I love Git and open source. I have a private account in which I keep a few
unfinished project.

### AgentNEO

Welcome to China, I have tried many ways to get across the [GFW](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Firewall){:rel='nofollow, external'} since I knew GFW exists.

I often need to consult a lot of first-hand information and go to
developer-friendly sites instead of opening sites like CSDN, which is a
cancerous part of the Internet.

One last time: Fuck the GFW.
