## Computer

I love Apple products.

I bought my third MacBook Pro(13-inch) at 2018. It has 16 GB memory and 512 GB of
storage.

But in the Office, I use a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015) to work.

## Camera

I am using Sony's Alpha 6000 APS-C Mirrorless Interchangeable Lens Camera,
with two lenses, the 16-50 mm F3.5-5.6 and  E 24mm F1.8 ZA.
