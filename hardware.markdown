## Computer

I love Apple products.

I bought my third [MacBook Pro(13-inch)](//www.apple.com/macbook-pro-13/)
at 2018. It has 16 GB memory and 512 GB of storage.

But in the Office, I use a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015) to
work.

## Camera

I am using [Sony's Alpha 6000 APS-C](//electronics.sony.com/imaging/interchangeable-lens-cameras/aps-c/p/ilce6000l-b)
Mirrorless Interchangeable Lens Camera,
with two lenses, the 16-50 mm F3.5-5.6 and
[E 24mm F1.8 ZA](https://electronics.sony.com/imaging/lenses/aps-c-e-mount/p/sel24f18z).
