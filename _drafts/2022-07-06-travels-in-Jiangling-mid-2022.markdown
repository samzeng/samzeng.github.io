At the beginning of July, I asked the kindergarten to give my son an early summer break.

After celebrating my son's birthday, the family took the high-speed train to Jiangling County in Hubei to take him back to his grandmother's house for a while.

## Gastronomy

We tried some of the local cuisine and spicy was the theme of every dish.


## Dike

Here, because of the plain and the proximity to the Yangtze River, there are many dikes.

After dinner one day, I ran up the embankment in my electric car in the cool breeze, with the sun just about to peek behind the mountains, and I seized these moments to take some photos.
